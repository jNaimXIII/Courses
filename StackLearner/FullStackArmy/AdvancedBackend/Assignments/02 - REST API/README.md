# REST API

## Assignment Description

- **Start Date**: 03/06/2023
- **Due Date**: 04/07/2023
- **Duration**: 1 month (complete the first two within next week)
- **Objective**: The objective of this assignment is to explore public APIs,
  understand RESTful API best practices, and apply that knowledge to design and
  create a new RESTful API.

### Instructions

1. **Research**:
   a. Explore and select three public APIs that are widely used and follow
   RESTful principles.
   b. Analyze and document the RESTful best practices implemented in each API,
   including their URL structure, resource naming conventions, HTTP methods
   usage, error handling, authentication mechanisms, and any other relevant
   aspects.
2. **API Design**:
   a. Identify a domain or topic of your choice for your new RESTful API.
   b. Define the resources and their relationships within the API.
   c. Design the URL structure following RESTful conventions and best
   practices.
   d. Determine the appropriate HTTP methods to be used for each resource and
   action.
   e. Incorporate pagination, filtering, sorting, and other relevant features
   as needed.
   f. Implement proper error handling and responses, including HTTP status
   codes and error messages.
   g. Consider the security aspects and define an authentication mechanism for
   accessing your API.
3. **API Implementation**:
   a. Choose a programming language and framework of your choice (e.g., Node.js
   with Express, Python with Flask, etc.).
   b. Implement the API endpoints based on the design decisions made in the
   previous step.
   c. Use appropriate data storage (database, in-memory storage, etc.) to store
   and retrieve the API resources.
   d. Implement request validation and error handling to ensure the API
   operates correctly.
4. **Documentation**:
   a. Create comprehensive documentation for your API, including the API
   endpoints, request/response structures, authentication requirements, and any
   other relevant information.
   b. Include usage examples and instructions for developers to interact with
   and consume your API effectively.
5. **Testing**:
   a. Develop a set of test cases to validate the functionality and behavior of
   your API endpoints.
   b. Implement automated tests using testing frameworks (e.g., Jest, Pytest)
   to ensure the correctness of your API implementation.
6. **Presentation**:
   a. Prepare a presentation to showcase your API design and implementation.
   b. Explain the RESTful best practices incorporated in your API and the
   reasoning behind your design decisions.
   c. Demonstrate the functionality of your API using sample requests and
   responses.
   d. Highlight any challenges faced during the implementation and how you
   addressed them.

### Submissions

- [ ] Submit a document detailing your analysis of the three selected public
      APIs and the RESTful best practices observed.
- [ ] Submit the API design documentation, including the URL structure,
      resource definitions, and API endpoints.
- [ ] Provide the implemented API code, along with instructions for running and
      testing the API.
- [ ] Submit any additional files, such as test cases or screenshots, if
      necessary.
- [ ] Include a link to your presentation or provide the presentation slides.
